## Project Architecture

### 3 Layers Of Data Types

We view the different data types in this project as if they are in 3 layers:

1. _Form Data_
2. _State Data_
3. _Dependency Data_

Data in each layer can flow in either direction, 1 <> 2 <> 3. We did this to avoid as many **run-time type related errors** as possible, and to decouple our user-friendly UI data from the backing state & dependency data.

These type definitions can be found in:

1. `src/lib/forms`
2. `src/lib/state`
3. `src/lib/dependency`

Confused? So were we, that's why we wrote this... here's a brief description of each layer:

- **Form Data**: This is user input data that needs to be sanitized before it can flow into the application's main state.

- **State Data**: This is the core state of the application.

- **Dependency Data**: These are the types that are provided by external dependencies. These types should not be accessible to the project as a whole, they should be constrained to the dependency's module. This way we can easily exchange the dependency.
